# EDA-Using-SweetViz-
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential early step in most data science projects and it often consists of taking the same steps to characterize a dataset (e.g. find out data types, missing information, distribution of values, correlations, etc.). Given the repetitiveness and similarity of such tasks, there are a few libraries that automate and help kickstart the process.
One of the latest is a new open-source Python library called Sweetviz , created by a few contributors and myself for just that purpose. It takes pandas dataframes and creates a self-contained HTML report.
